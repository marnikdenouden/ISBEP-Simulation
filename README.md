# Overview
Robot simulation for the Innovation Space Bachelor End Project (ISBEP)

# Components

- Timeline
> [!TIP]
> It is also possible to test the connection with timeline data without setting up the simulation. You can do this by running the communicator.py file, but only after commenting out all error causing imports omni that get referenced when running the communicator.py file.

# Simulation installation

- Ensure all local [dependencies](#dependencies) are met
- Create a new folder named `git_isaac_sim` in `omni.isaac.examples.user_examples` folder of [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim).
- Clone [this](https://github.com/marnikdenouden/ISBEP-Simulation) repository into the newly created folder

# Simulation usage
In order to run an installed simulation follow the next steps.
