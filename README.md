# Overview
Robot simulation for the Innovation Space Bachelor End Project (ISBEP)

# Components

- Timeline
> [!TIP]
> It is also possible to test the connection with timeline data without setting up the simulation. You can do this by running the communicator.py file, but only after commenting out all error causing imports omni that get referenced when running the communicator.py file.

# Simulation installation

- Ensure all local [dependencies](#dependencies) are met
- Create a new folder named `git_isaac_sim` in `omni.isaac.examples.user_examples` folder of [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim).
- Clone [this](https://github.com/marnikdenouden/ISBEP-Simulation) repository into the newly created folder

# Simulation usage
In order to run an installed simulation follow the next steps.

# Dependencies
[Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim) is required for running and developing this project. The simulation code uses [python](https://www.python.org/) and some additional modules, which could be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). Even though python is already included in [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim) it might still need to be updated or have modules installed by following [Isaac sim python install](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_python.html).

## Local requirements
Download and install the following software.
- [Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/index.html) (Includes python)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (For running without simulation)
